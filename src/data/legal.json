          "TCPA regulations require that companies obtain consent from consumers prior to sending any sort of text or automated telephone messages. For HIPAA covered entities, requirements for how consent is obtained are different depending on whether the messaging only contains health-related information or if it includes marketing-focused content. AppDilly automates text message communications, but you are responsible for ensuring that the recipients of those communications have provided prior express written consent to receive them. Consent for Informational Health Care Messages : For HIPAA covered entities sending informational only health-related messages, the patient's consent can be written, electronic or verbal. With these guidelines, you can send your patients informational messages about their health care. Such health-related informational messages include appointment reminders without marketing content. We strongly recommend that your \"Notice of Privacy Practices\" or \"Privacy Policy\" specifically state that you may use your patient's landline or cell phone number to contact them with informational messages, specifically, that third party business associates may text them with reminders. We also suggest that you obtain written acknowledgement from each patient stating that they have received and reviewed your privacy policy. While these steps are a best practice, consent can also be obtained from patients in other ways (verbal consent is acceptable.). Specifically, by entering a cell phone number into your management system or the AppDilly system and not opting such cell phone out of the AppDilly text message feature, you are directing AppDilly to automatically send text message reminders and other communications to such cell phone and certifying that the user of such cell phone consents to the receipt of those messages."
